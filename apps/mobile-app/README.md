## üì± API Integration

This mobile app integrates with the CheckRight Laravel API located in `../api/`.

2. **Multi-tenant Support**: Automatically handles tenant context
3. **Secure Storage**: Tokens stored securely using Expo SecureStore

### Environment Configuration

Update your `.env` file with API settings:

```env
# API Configuration
API_URL=http://localhost:8000  # For local development
# API_URL=https://api.checkright.com  # For production

# Mobile specific settings
APP_ENV=development
EXPO_ACCOUNT_OWNER=your-expo-username
EAS_PROJECT_ID=your-eas-project-id
```

### API Endpoints Used

- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/user` - Get authenticated user
- Additional endpoints documented in API README

## Why Expo and not React Native CLI?

We have been using Expo as our main framework since the introduction of [Continuous Native Generation (CNG)](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/) concept and we are happy with the experience.

I think this question is not valid anymore, especially after the last React conference when the core React native team recommended using Expo for new projects.

> "As of today, the only recommended community framework for React Native is Expo. Folks at Expo have been investing in the React Native ecosystem since the early days of React Native and as of today, we believe the developer experience offered by Expo is best in class." React native core team
