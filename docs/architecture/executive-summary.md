# Executive Summary
* **Overall Architecture Readiness:** High
* **Critical Risks Identified:** None. The architecture is robust, and potential risks (e.g., vendor lock-in, missed webhooks) have standard mitigation patterns that will be implemented.
* **Key Strengths:** The architecture is modern, scalable (serverless), and highly testable. The use of a monorepo and shared types will improve developer velocity and reduce bugs.
