### Section 1: Goals and Background Context

**Goals**
This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of "CheckRight." The primary goals of this MVP are to deliver a product that achieves the following outcomes for our initial users:

* **1. Reduce Administrative Overhead**
  * **Technical Outcomes:** The system must support the dynamic creation, updating, and deletion of multi-step inspection checklists with various question types (pass/fail, photo upload, text). All inspection data must be stored in a structured, relational format, linked to a specific user, asset, and tenant.
  * **User Experience Outcomes:** Empower the "Operations/Fleet Manager" persona with an intuitive, drag-and-drop interface for checklist building that requires no technical expertise. The main dashboard should provide an at-a-glance, real-time overview of the fleet's inspection status.

* **2. Improve Compliance & Accountability**
  * **Technical Outcomes:** Every inspection submission must be immutable and logged with a precise timestamp, user ID, and asset ID. The system must enforce a basic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, clearly separating Admin and Inspector privileges.
  * **User Experience Outcomes:** The platform must provide managers with a clear, easily searchable digital audit trail. For the "Field Operator" persona, their submission history should be easily accessible, providing them with a verifiable record of their work.

* **3. Accelerate Maintenance Cycles**
  * **Technical Outcomes:** The system must be able to flag failed inspection items and trigger an internal event. A mechanism must be in place to send a formatted email notification containing key inspection data to a pre-configured supplier address.
  * **User Experience Outcomes:** When a critical issue is logged by an operator, the platform must provide a clear, one-click action for the manager to notify a supplier, bridging the gap between problem identification and resolution.

* **4. Increase Operator Efficiency**
  * **Technical Outcomes:** The mobile application must be a cross-platform solution (iOS/Android) built with React Native. It must have offline capabilities, queueing submissions for synchronization when connectivity is restored. The API response times for submitting an inspection should be under 500ms.
  * **User Experience Outcomes:** The mobile experience for the "Field Operator" must be exceptionally fast and simple, designed for completion in under 2 minutes. The UI should be optimized for use in varied field conditions (e.g., large touch targets, high-contrast design).

**Background Context**
"CheckRight" is being developed to address the significant inefficiencies and risks associated with manual, paper-based vehicle and machinery inspection processes. This PRD focuses on an MVP to validate the core digital workflow.

**For the Design Team:** The primary design challenge is to create a dual-experience product that is both a powerful administrative tool for the "Operations/Fleet Manager" and a lightning-fast, simple utility for the "Field Operator."

**For the Technical Team:** The MVP will be built on a shared-database, multi-tenant architecture using the `stancl/tenancy` package. This is a pragmatic choice to validate the core feature set and user experience with minimal initial complexity. The backend will be built on Laravel 12, exposing a secure API for the React Native mobile client.
