### Section 3: User Interface Design Goals

**Overall UX Vision**
The platform will have a dual-UI vision. For the **Company Admin (Web Dashboard)**, the experience should feel like a powerful "mission control"â€”data-rich and efficient. For the **Inspector (Mobile App)**, the experience must be a lightning-fast, simple, and foolproof "field tool."

**Core Screens and Views**

* **Web Admin:** Login, Inspection Dashboard, Asset Management, Checklist Builder, Supplier Management, User Management, Branding Configuration.
* **Mobile App:** Login, Asset Selection, Inspection View, Inspection Summary, Submission Confirmation.

**Accessibility**

* **Standard:** **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**.

**Branding**

* The platform will support tenant-specific branding. Company Admins will have the ability to upload their own company logo and select a primary brand color.

**Animations and Transitions**

* The user interface will incorporate subtle and professional animations to enhance the user experience, including smooth page transitions and loading indicators.

**Target Device and Platforms**

* The platform will target **Web Responsive** for the Admin Dashboard (desktop-first) and **Cross-Platform** (iOS & Android via React Native) for the Inspector's Mobile App (mobile-first).
