### Component Specifications
No UI components required for this foundational story.

### File Locations
Project structure based on monorepo architecture: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure-monorepo.md]
```
/
├── apps/
│   ├── api/          # Laravel + Filament Application
│   └── mobile/       # React Native Application (future)
├── packages/
│   └── shared/       # Shared TypeScript types (future)
└── package.json      # Root package manager
```

### Technical Constraints
- Service Architecture: Designed for serverless environment (AWS Lambda via Laravel Vapor) [Source: architecture/backend-architecture-laravel.md]
- Data Access: Repository Pattern implementation for testability
- Authentication: Laravel Sanctum for API routes, session auth for Filament web panel
- Database: MySQL 8.x [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Multi-tenancy: Global stancl/tenancy middleware scoping

### External API Integration Requirements
- Stripe integration via Laravel Cashier (for future implementation) [Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
- Amazon SES for transactional emails via Laravel's native mail driver

## Testing

### Testing Standards
Testing framework and strategy: [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: Pest for backend testing
- **Integration Tests**: Pest for service layer interactions
- **Test Structure**: Follow testing pyramid approach
- **Test Location**: Tests should be located in standard Laravel `tests/` directory
- **Coding Standards**: All code must pass Pint linting checks [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
