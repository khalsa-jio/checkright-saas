3. Password must meet security requirements and be confirmed
4. User account is created with proper tenant scoping and role assignment from the invitation
5. Invitation is marked as accepted and cannot be reused
6. User is automatically logged in after successful registration
7. User can subsequently log in using their email and password
8. Login respects tenant isolation and role-based access control
9. User sessions are properly managed with secure authentication tokens
10. Failed login attempts are logged and rate-limited
11. User can access appropriate areas based on their assigned role
12. "Remember Me" functionality extends session duration for a configurable number of days
13. Remember Me preference is securely stored and managed on the device
14. Mobile app leverages modern UI patterns, theming, and navigation from the starter template

```

### Technical Constraints
Service Architecture: [Source: architecture/44-backend-architecture-laravel.md]
- Serverless environment compatibility (AWS Lambda via Laravel Vapor)
- Repository Pattern for data access layer abstraction
- Laravel Sanctum for API authentication with tenant scoping
- Global stancl/tenancy middleware for request scoping

### Mobile-App Specific Constraints
**Expo and React Native:** [Source: mobile-app starter analysis]
- Expo 53 with expo-router for navigation (NOT React Navigation as originally specified)
- NativeWind for styling (NOT traditional StyleSheet)
- React Query for API state management (enhanced pattern beyond basic Axios)
- MMKV for storage (enhanced performance over AsyncStorage)
- Modern React 19.0 and React Native 0.79.4

### Configuration Requirements
Remember Me Functionality Configuration:
- Add to `config/auth.php`: `'remember_me_duration_days' => env('AUTH_REMEMBER_ME_DURATION_DAYS', 30)`
- Environment variable: `AUTH_REMEMBER_ME_DURATION_DAYS=30` (configurable per deployment)
- LoginRequest validation: `'remember_me' => 'boolean'` (optional field)
- Token expiration logic: Standard (24h) vs Remember Me (configurable days)
- Secure storage: Use React Native MMKV for persistent Remember Me preference + Keychain for sensitive tokens

### Authentication & Authorization
Authentication Strategy: [Source: architecture/44-backend-architecture-laravel.md]
- Laravel Sanctum for API token protection with configurable expiration
- Global stancl/tenancy middleware scoping for all requests
- Role-based access control using User model role field
- Secure token storage and management on mobile device using mobile-app stack
- **Remember Me Configuration**: Configurable token expiration duration
  - Standard login tokens: 24 hours (default)
  - Remember Me tokens: 30 days (configurable via `config/auth.php`)
  - Configuration key: `auth.remember_me_duration_days`
- **Token Management**: Different expiration handling based on Remember Me preference
- **Secure Storage**: Remember Me preference stored securely in React Native MMKV, tokens in Keychain

### Migration Strategy from Existing Mobile Directory
**Content Preservation:** [Source: apps/mobile/ analysis]
- Existing auth store patterns in `src/features/auth/stores/authStore.ts`
- Authentication flow logic from `src/features/auth/components/`
- API type definitions and validation patterns
- Test patterns and mocking strategies
- Deep linking utility functions

**Package Safety Considerations:**
- mobile-app starter has comprehensive, production-tested package set
- AVOID modifying package.json unless absolutely necessary
- Leverage existing packages: prefer Zustand over Redux, React Query over SWR, NativeWind over styled-components
- Use expo-router patterns instead of React Navigation stack
- Prefer MMKV over AsyncStorage for performance

### External API Integration Requirements
Email Integration: [Source: architecture/33-external-apis.md]
- Amazon SES already configured for transactional emails
- Integration handles tenant-specific contexts and branding
- Activity logging for authentication events

### Testing Standards
Testing framework and strategy: [Source: architecture/61-testing-strategy.md + mobile-app analysis]
- **Unit Tests:** Jest for mobile-app authentication services and components
- **Integration Tests:** React Native Testing Library for authentication flow testing
- **E2E Tests:** Mobile-app's existing testing setup for critical user authentication flows
- **Test Location:** Follow mobile-app testing patterns in `__tests__/` directories
- **Coding Standards:** ESLint and Prettier configuration from mobile-app starter
