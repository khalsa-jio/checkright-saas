# Story 1.3: Invited User Registration & Login

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** new user who has received an invitation,
**I want** to securely set up my account and log in to the system,
**so that** I can access the CheckRight application with my assigned role and begin using the features available to me.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can access the invitation link from their email and see a registration form
2. User must provide required information (name, password) while email is pre-populated from invitation
3. Password must meet security requirements and be confirmed
4. User account is created with proper tenant scoping and role assignment from the invitation
5. Invitation is marked as accepted and cannot be reused
6. User is automatically logged in after successful registration
7. User can subsequently log in using their email and password
8. Login respects tenant isolation and role-based access control
9. User sessions are properly managed with secure authentication tokens
10. Failed login attempts are logged and rate-limited
11. User can access appropriate areas based on their assigned role
12. "Remember Me" functionality extends session duration for a configurable number of days
13. Remember Me preference is securely stored and managed on the device

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 (Super Admin Tenant Creation):
- TenantCreationService already contains `acceptInvitation` method with comprehensive validation and error handling
- Invitation model exists with cryptographically secure tokens (`bin2hex(random_bytes(32))`)
- User model enhanced with tenant fields and roles (admin, manager, operator)
- Activity logging implemented for invitation acceptance and user registration
- Comprehensive custom exceptions available: InvitationException, TenantValidationException
- Email system configured and tested with proper tenant context
- All models use proper stancl/tenancy integration with UUID support

### Data Models
Core entities for this story: [Source: architecture/22-data-models.md]
- **User:** Individual users with roles (admin, manager, operator) and lifecycle fields (last_login_at, deleted_at, must_change_password)
- **Company (Tenant):** Root entity already established with proper tenant isolation
- **Invitation:** Existing model with secure token generation and validation methods

### Critical Gap Analysis

**INCOMPLETE TASKS** - The following essential mobile components are missing:

1. **React Native Registration Screens** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 6)
   - AcceptInvitationScreen component 
   - Deep link handling for invitation URLs
   - Frontend password validation
   - Registration success screen

2. **React Native Login Screens** (AC: 7, 8, 9, 12, 13)  
   - LoginScreen with Remember Me checkbox
   - Secure token storage with React Native Keychain
   - Token expiration handling
   - Password reset functionality prep

3. **Authentication State Management** (AC: 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13)
   - Zustand store for auth state
   - Token refresh logic
   - Automatic logout handling  
   - Navigation guards

4. **Mobile Integration Testing**
   - React Native authentication screen tests

### Compliance Check

- ✅ **Backend Coding Standards**: Excellent adherence to Laravel standards
- ✅ **Backend Project Structure**: Perfect alignment with monorepo structure  
- ✅ **Backend Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive backend test coverage
- ❌ **All ACs Met**: INCOMPLETE - Mobile UI requirements not satisfied

### Acceptance Criteria Assessment

**Backend ACs: FULLY SATISFIED** ✅
- AC 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11: ✅ API functionality complete
- AC 7: ✅ Login API with proper authentication
- AC 12, 13: ✅ Remember Me backend implementation

**Frontend ACs: NOT SATISFIED** ❌  
- AC 1, 2, 3: ❌ Registration form UI missing
- AC 6: ❌ Auto-login after registration (mobile UI)
- AC 12, 13: ❌ Remember Me UI and device storage missing

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring needed - the backend code quality is excellent as delivered.

### Security Review

✅ **Backend Security: EXCELLENT**
- Proper CSRF token handling
- Rate limiting implementation  
- Secure password validation
- Role-based token abilities
- Audit logging for all auth events
- Tenant isolation properly implemented

❌ **Mobile Security: NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- Secure token storage (Keychain) not implemented
- Deep link security not implemented

### Performance Considerations

✅ **Backend Performance: EXCELLENT**
- Efficient database queries
- Proper caching strategies  
- Rate limiting for protection
- Token expiration management

### Recommendations

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

1. **Deploy Mobile App Developer** - The story requires React Native expertise to complete the mobile components
2. **Update Story Status** - Should remain "Approved" (not "Done") until mobile implementation is complete
3. **Clarify Development Responsibility** - Determine if backend-only delivery was intended or if full-stack delivery was expected

### Final Status

❌ **CHANGES REQUIRED - Mobile Implementation Missing**

**Summary**: The backend implementation is **production-ready and excellent quality**, but the story cannot be marked as complete until the React Native mobile components are implemented. This appears to be a **scope/responsibility clarification issue** rather than a quality issue with the delivered backend code.
