# Story 1.5: Mobile Security Architecture Implementation

## Status
Approved
## Story
**As a** system administrator and mobile app user  
**I want** a comprehensive security architecture for mobile-backend communication  
**So that** the API is protected from unauthorized access and mobile users have secure, authenticated access to tenant-scoped resources

**Story Points:** 13  
**Priority:** Critical (Security)  
**Dependencies:** Story 1.4 (Hierarchical User Management)  
**Estimated Duration:** 8 weeks

## Background
The current mobile application connects to the Laravel backend using basic Laravel Sanctum tokens without proper mobile-specific security measures. This creates critical vulnerabilities:

- No API key authentication beyond bearer tokens
- Missing device binding and mobile-specific security
- Lack of request signing and replay attack protection
- Insufficient rate limiting and abuse prevention
- No security monitoring or threat detection
- Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle and token theft attacks

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC 1: Multi-Layer Authentication
- [ ] **Enhanced API authentication** with API keys + bearer tokens + device binding
- [ ] **Biometric authentication integration** for sensitive operations (user management, invitations)
- [ ] **Device fingerprinting** to bind tokens to specific mobile devices
- [ ] **Certificate pinning** to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- [ ] **JWT with automatic rotation** (15-30 minute access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens)

### AC 2: Request Security & Validation
- [ ] **HMAC request signing** for all sensitive API operations
- [ ] **Timestamp validation** with 5-minute window to prevent replay attacks
- [ ] **Nonce-based protection** for idempotent operations
- [ ] **Input validation middleware** with sanitization and encoding
- [ ] **Rate limiting per user/tenant/endpoint** with adaptive thresholds

### AC 3: Mobile-Specific Security
- [ ] **Root/jailbreak detection** with graceful degradation
- [ ] **App integrity verification** using code signing validation
- [ ] **Secure token storage** using iOS Keychain and Android KeyStore
- [ ] **Screen recording/screenshot protection** for sensitive screens
- [ ] **Network security** with TLS 1.3 and certificate validation

### AC 4: Authorization & Permissions
- [ ] **Resource-level permissions** beyond role-based access control
- [ ] **Tenant isolation enforcement** at API middleware level
- [ ] **Dynamic permission evaluation** based on user context and risk
- [ ] **Permission caching** with TTL for performance
- [ ] **Audit logging** for all authorization decisions

### AC 5: Threat Detection & Monitoring
- [ ] **Real-time anomaly detection** for unusual access patterns
- [ ] **Geographic access monitoring** with location-based risk scoring
- [ ] **Failed authentication tracking** with progressive lockout
- [ ] **Security event logging** with structured data for analysis
- [ ] **Automated incident response** for critical security events
