# Story 1.6: User-Initiated Password Reset

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** registered user of the CheckRight platform  
**I want** to request a password reset link via email when I've forgotten my password  
**So that** I can regain access to my account securely without requiring admin intervention

## Epic Context
This story is part of **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Tenancy** and addresses **FR13** (password reset functionality) from the requirements. It implements the user-initiated portion of password reset functionality, complementing the admin-forced password reset that will be implemented in Story 1.7.

## Background
Currently, users who forget their passwords have no self-service option to reset them. This creates unnecessary support overhead and prevents users from accessing their accounts when admins are unavailable. The implementation should leverage Laravel's built-in password reset functionality while ensuring proper tenant isolation and security.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **AC1:** User can request password reset from login page
  - Given a user is on the login page
  - When they click "Forgot Password?" link
  - Then they are redirected to password reset request form

- [ ] **AC2:** Password reset email is sent to registered users
  - Given a user enters their registered email address
  - When they submit the password reset form
  - Then a password reset email is sent to their email address
  - And the email contains a secure, time-limited reset link

- [ ] **AC3:** Password reset link validation and security
  - Given a user receives a password reset email
  - When they click the reset link
  - Then they are directed to a secure password reset form
  - And the link expires after 60 minutes
  - And the link can only be used once

- [ ] **AC4:** New password validation and update
  - Given a user accesses the password reset form with a valid token
  - When they enter and confirm a new password meeting security requirements
  - Then their password is updated in the system
  - And they are redirected to login with a success message

- [ ] **AC5:** Tenant isolation and security
  - Given a user from one tenant requests password reset
  - When the reset process is completed
  - Then only users within the same tenant context are affected
  - And no cross-tenant information is exposed

- [ ] **AC6:** Email template and branding
  - Given a password reset email is sent
  - When the user receives it
  - Then the email uses professional CheckRight branding
  - And contains clear instructions for password reset
  - And includes appropriate security warnings

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] **TR1:** Use Laravel's built-in password reset functionality
- [ ] **TR2:** Implement proper tenant scoping for password resets
- [ ] **TR3:** Ensure CSRF protection on all forms
- [ ] **TR4:** Rate limiting on password reset requests (max 5 per hour per IP)
- [ ] **TR5:** Secure password validation rules (minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- [ ] **TR6:** Email queue integration for reliable delivery

### Security Requirements
- [ ] **SR1:** Password reset tokens expire after 60 minutes
- [ ] **SR2:** Tokens are single-use only
- [ ] **SR3:** No sensitive information exposed in email content
- [ ] **SR4:** Failed reset attempts are logged for security monitoring
- [ ] **SR5:** Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks

- Implement password strength requirements
- Add confirmation and success/error messaging

#### Task 1.6.6: Update Login Page
- Add "Forgot Password?" link to login form
- Ensure consistent styling with existing UI
- Test user flow from login to password reset

### Phase 3: Email Templates (Day 5)

- Verify rate limiting functionality
- Test tenant isolation in password reset process

#### Task 1.6.10: Integration Testing
- Test complete password reset user journey
- Verify email delivery and template rendering
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes
No new tables required - Laravel's built-in `password_reset_tokens` table will be used with proper tenant scoping.

### Security Considerations
- Password reset tokens will be hashed and stored securely
- Rate limiting will prevent abuse (5 attempts per hour per IP)
- Email content will not contain sensitive information
- All password reset attempts will be logged for security monitoring

### Email Configuration
- Use Laravel's mail queue for reliable delivery
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Template will include CheckRight branding and security messaging

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite:** Story 1.4 (Hierarchical User Management) - User authentication system
- **Prerequisite:** Story 1.5 (Mobile Security Architecture) - Security infrastructure
- **Integrates with:** Existing Laravel authentication system
- **Follows:** Multi-tenancy patterns established in previous stories

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and tested
- [ ] User can successfully reset password via email
- [ ] Security requirements implemented and verified
- [ ] Tenant isolation maintained throughout process
- [ ] Email templates professional and functional
- [ ] Rate limiting and security logging in place
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk:** Email delivery failures
  - **Mitigation:** Implement queue-based email with retry logic
- **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities in reset process
  - **Mitigation:** Use Laravel's battle-tested password reset system
- **Risk:** Cross-tenant information leakage
  - **Mitigation:** Implement thorough tenant scoping tests

## Success Metrics
- Users can successfully reset passwords without admin intervention
- Password reset completion rate > 85%
- No security incidents related to password reset
- Support tickets for password issues reduced by 70%
