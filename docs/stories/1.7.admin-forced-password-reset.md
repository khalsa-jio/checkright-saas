# Story 1.7: Admin-Forced Password Reset

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Company Admin or Manager with user management permissions  
**I want** to force a user to reset their password on their next login  
**So that** I can maintain security compliance and respond to security incidents or policy violations

## Epic Context
This story is part of **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Tenancy** and addresses **FR14** (admin-forced password reset functionality) from the requirements. It builds upon the user-initiated password reset system implemented in Story 1.6 and integrates with the hierarchical user management from Story 1.4, providing administrative password security controls.

## Background
While users can reset their own passwords (Story 1.6), administrators need the ability to force password resets for security compliance, suspected compromises, or policy violations. This functionality should leverage the existing password reset infrastructure while adding administrative controls, audit logging, and notification systems.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **AC1:** Admin can force password reset from user management interface
  - Given a Company Admin or Manager is viewing a user's profile
  - When they select "Force Password Reset" action
  - Then the user is immediately marked as requiring password reset
  - And the user receives a notification email about the forced reset

- [ ] **AC2:** Forced password reset blocks user access
  - Given a user has been marked for forced password reset
  - When they attempt to login with current credentials
  - Then they are redirected to password reset flow
  - And cannot access the application until password is changed

- [ ] **AC3:** Admin can specify reset reason and message
  - Given an admin is forcing a password reset
  - When they complete the force reset action
  - Then they can provide a reason (security, compliance, policy)
  - And optionally include a custom message for the user

- [ ] **AC4:** Bulk password reset for multiple users
  - Given an admin selects multiple users in the management interface
  - When they choose "Force Password Reset" bulk action
  - Then all selected users are marked for forced reset
  - And each receives individual notification emails

- [ ] **AC5:** User notification and guidance
  - Given a user has been forced to reset their password
  - When they receive the notification email
  - Then it explains why the reset was required
  - And provides clear instructions for completing the reset
  - And includes contact information for administrative support

- [ ] **AC6:** Mobile app forced reset handling
  - Given a mobile user has been forced to reset their password
  - When they attempt to use the app
  - Then they receive appropriate in-app notification
  - And are guided through the mobile password reset flow
  - And mobile tokens are invalidated until reset is complete

- [ ] **AC7:** Audit logging and compliance tracking
  - Given an admin forces a password reset
  - When the action is completed
  - Then the event is logged with admin identity, timestamp, and reason
  - And the log includes user impact and completion status
  - And audit trail is maintained for compliance reporting

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] **TR1:** Extend existing password reset infrastructure from Story 1.6
- [ ] **TR2:** Add `force_password_reset` flag to user model with migration
- [ ] **TR3:** Implement middleware to check forced reset status on authentication
- [ ] **TR4:** Create admin interface using Filament admin panel
- [ ] **TR5:** Integrate with existing hierarchical permissions from Story 1.4
- [ ] **TR6:** Leverage mobile security infrastructure from Story 1.5
- [ ] **TR7:** Implement bulk operations with queue processing for large user sets

### Security Requirements
- [ ] **SR1:** Only authorized admins can force password resets (role-based permissions)
- [ ] **SR2:** Forced reset action requires admin re-authentication for sensitive operations
- [ ] **SR3:** All forced reset activities logged for security audit trail
- [ ] **SR4:** Mobile tokens invalidated immediately upon forced reset
- [ ] **SR5:** Rate limiting to prevent abuse of forced reset functionality
- [ ] **SR6:** Tenant isolation ensures admins can only affect users in their tenant

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Migration: Add forced password reset columns to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN force_password_reset BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN force_reset_reason VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN force_reset_message TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN force_reset_initiated_by BIGINT UNSIGNED;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN force_reset_initiated_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE users ADD FOREIGN KEY (force_reset_initiated_by) REFERENCES users(id);
```

### Service Layer Architecture
```php
// Enhanced Password Reset Service
class PasswordResetService
{
    public function forceUserPasswordReset(
        User $user, 
        User $admin, 
        string $reason, 
        ?string $message = null
    ): void
    
    public function bulkForcePasswordReset(
        Collection $users, 
        User $admin, 
        string $reason, 
        ?string $message = null
    ): void
    
    public function completePasswordReset(User $user): void
    
    public function clearForceResetFlag(User $user): void
}
```
