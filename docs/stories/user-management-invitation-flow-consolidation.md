# User Management & Invitation Flow Consolidation

**Story ID**: UMG-001  
**Status**: Ready for Review  
**Priority**: High  
**Assigned To**: Developer  
**Created**: 2025-01-14

## Story

Consolidate user creation and invitation flows into a unified UserResource interface. Currently, there are two separate systems for user management:

1. **UserResource** - Direct user creation (supports all roles including super-admin)
2. **InvitationResource** - Invitation-based creation (supports admin, manager, operator only)

This creates UX confusion and inconsistent workflows. The new system should:

- **Hide InvitationResource** from navigation (keep model/functionality for processing)
- **Enhance UserResource** with dual creation modes: "Send Invitation" vs "Create User Directly"
- **Restrict invitations** to admin and operator roles only (super-admin cannot be invited)
- **Filter invitation table** to show only pending invitations by default
- **Maintain all existing security** and role-based permission structures

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: UserResource Creation Mode Selection
- [ ] Create form shows radio button or toggle to select creation method:
  - "Send Invitation" (default for admin/operator roles)
  - "Create User Directly" (available for all roles)
- [ ] Form fields adapt based on selected method:
  - **Invitation mode**: Email + Role selection only
  - **Direct creation mode**: Name + Email + Password + Role + Must Change Password toggle

### AC2: Role-Based Invitation Restrictions  
- [ ] Invitations can only be sent for "admin" and "operator" roles
- [ ] Super-admin role must use direct creation (no invitation option)
- [ ] Manager role can use either method based on user preference
- [ ] Role restrictions respect existing permission hierarchy (managers can only invite operators)

### AC3: InvitationResource UI Changes
- [ ] Remove InvitationResource from main navigation
- [ ] Keep invitation table accessible via UserResource (as tab or section)
- [ ] Default invitation table filter shows only pending invitations (status = 'Pending')
- [ ] Hide accepted invitations unless explicitly filtered to show them

### AC4: Form Logic & Validation
- [ ] When "Send Invitation" selected and role is "super-admin" → Show validation error
- [ ] When "Send Invitation" selected → Hide name/password fields, show invitation-specific fields
- [ ] When "Create User Directly" selected → Show full user creation form
- [ ] Email validation prevents duplicate invitations for pending invites
- [ ] Maintain existing tenant isolation and permission checks

### AC5: Backend Processing
- [ ] Invitation creation flow remains unchanged (existing CreateInvitation logic)
- [ ] Direct user creation flow remains unchanged (existing CreateUser logic)  
- [ ] Route selection happens in UserResource based on form mode
- [ ] Maintain existing notification and email sending functionality

## Technical Analysis

### Current State Analysis

**UserResource.php** (Lines 35-78):
- Full user creation form with name, email, password, role, must_change_password
- Role options filtered by current user permissions (lines 246-282)
- Supports all roles based on user hierarchy

**InvitationResource.php** (Lines 31-54):
- Simple form: email, role (admin/manager/operator only), expires_at
- Missing super-admin role support
- Separate navigation item and interface

**CreateInvitation.php** (Lines 21-50):
- Handles invitation creation, tenant assignment, email dispatch
- Uses SendInvitationEmailJob for email delivery
- Generates secure tokens and expiration dates

### Required Changes Overview

1. **UserResource Form Enhancement**
   - Add creation method selection (radio/toggle)
   - Conditional field display based on method
   - Role-based invitation restrictions
   - Form validation updates

2. **Navigation & UI Updates**
   - Hide InvitationResource from navigation
   - Integrate invitation management into UserResource
   - Update table filters and default views

3. **Backend Logic Integration**
   - Route form submissions to appropriate handlers
   - Maintain existing security and validation
   - Preserve email notification functionality

## Dev Notes

### Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Enhance UserResource form with dual modes
2. **Phase 2**: Implement backend routing logic  
3. **Phase 3**: Update navigation and invitation table integration
4. **Phase 4**: Testing and validation

### Key Considerations
- **Maintain Security**: All existing permission checks and tenant isolation must remain
- **Preserve Functionality**: Existing invitation acceptance flow must work unchanged
- **User Experience**: Form should be intuitive with clear mode selection
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing invitations must continue to work

### Technical Dependencies
- Filament form conditional display components
- Existing invitation email system (SendInvitationEmailJob)
- User and Invitation models (no changes needed)
- Tenant system integration

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests Required
- [ ] UserResource form validation for both modes
- [ ] Role-based invitation restrictions
- [ ] Form field conditional display logic
- [ ] Backend routing to correct creation handlers

### Feature Tests Required
- [ ] Super-admin cannot send invitations for super-admin role
- [ ] Admin can send invitations for admin/operator roles
- [ ] Manager can only send invitations for operator role
- [ ] Direct creation works for all permitted roles
- [ ] Email notifications sent correctly for invitations
- [ ] Invitation table filtering works as expected

### Integration Tests Required
- [ ] Full invitation flow: creation → email → acceptance → user creation
- [ ] Direct user creation with proper tenant assignment
- [ ] Permission checks work across all user types
- [ ] Navigation changes don't break existing functionality

## Tasks

### Task 1: Enhance UserResource Form with Creation Mode Selection
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

#### Subtasks:
- [x] Add creation mode selection component to form (radio buttons or toggle)
- [x] Implement conditional field display logic
- [x] Update form validation rules for both modes
- [x] Add role-based restrictions for invitation mode
- [x] Test form behavior with different user roles

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/Filament/Resources/UserResource.php` (form method)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use `Forms\Components\Radio` or `Forms\Components\Toggle` for mode selection
- Use `visible()` and `hidden()` methods for conditional field display
- Add custom validation rule to prevent super-admin invitations

### Task 2: Implement Backend Creation Logic Routing  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

#### Subtasks:
- [x] Create or modify UserResource CreateUser page to handle both modes
- [x] Route invitation mode to existing CreateInvitation logic
- [x] Route direct creation to existing user creation logic
- [x] Maintain existing notification and success messages
- [x] Test both creation paths work correctly

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/Filament/Resources/UserResource/Pages/CreateUser.php`
- Possibly create new shared service/trait for creation logic

**Implementation Notes**:
- Check form data to determine creation mode
- Reuse existing CreateInvitation handleRecordCreation logic for invitations
- Ensure tenant assignment and permission checks remain intact

### Task 3: Update Navigation and Hide InvitationResource
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

#### Subtasks:
- [x] Hide InvitationResource from navigation (set navigation visibility)
- [x] Add invitation management tab/section to UserResource if needed
- [x] Update invitation table default filters to show pending only
- [x] Ensure invitation actions (resend, delete) still accessible
- [x] Test navigation changes don't break functionality

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/Filament/Resources/InvitationResource.php` (navigation settings)
- Possibly `app/Filament/Resources/UserResource.php` (add relations/tabs)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Set `protected static bool $shouldRegisterNavigation = false;` in InvitationResource
- Consider adding invitation table as relation or separate tab in UserResource
- Update default table query to show pending invitations only

### Task 4: Update Invitation Table Filtering and Display
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

#### Subtasks:
- [x] Modify InvitationResource table to default to pending invitations
- [x] Add filter options to show all/pending/accepted/expired
- [x] Update table query to respect new default filtering
- [x] Test filtering functionality works correctly

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/Filament/Resources/InvitationResource.php` (table method and getEloquentQuery)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Update `getEloquentQuery()` method to filter pending by default
- Add table filters for invitation status
- Consider using scopes from Invitation model (pending, expired)
